## Course Organizations and Primary Repositories

- Course organizations should have the format **NAIT-WEBDxxxx** (where **xxxx** is the course number)(or DSGN if it's not a WEBD course) Please contact Tom Maurer to create them
- If you don't have a primary repository for your course yet please contact Tom Maurer, who will create it for you.

### What should be in the course organization vs here?
- **Course organization**: Assignment templates (anything for github classroom), semester example repos/workbooks, and student assignments. Essentially anything that students need to see or use.
- **This organization**: Course Development, resources (the github "primary course repo" see [contributor guide](https://github.com/NAIT-Digital-Design/.github/tree/main/contributer-guide)), assignment solutions. Essentialy anything that is only for instructors or contributors to the course.
- This division will prevent permission slipping where students could accidentally access solutions, and keep this organization clean of the hundreds of student repos created every semester
